# Ciphertext Clustering
.ipynb files for converting text to ciphertext, attempting to cluster ciphertext from different families, and graphing them on a feature scatterplot

## Requirements
* Jupyter Notebook and Python 3.7
* Libraries: numpy, matplotlib, scipy, sklearn, pycipher

## Files
* Cipher Encryptor: Used for encrypting plaintext (a dataset of questions, SQuAD, is given for use) and storing them as .csv for reuse.
* Ciphertext Clustering: Used for classifying and graphing ciphertext enciphering methods through clustering.
